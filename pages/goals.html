				<h2>Statement of Career Goals</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>I see myself using the skills that I’ve developed through my college career to help a firm develop revolutionary software that helps people around the world be their best selves. My goal is also to advance my own understanding of systems through projects and experience during and after my undergraduate career. I am a dedicated and enthusiastic first-year Computer Science student looking to make an impact through software development by building systems for customers. I am seeking an opportunity to grow as a developer and as a student.</p>
				<p>I have already made progress towards this goal with the projects I’ve completed over the past few years along with my work experiences in the CS field. My experiences have prepared me for a wide range of industry tasks including Web Development in a variety of ecosystems, embedded programming, and low level C and assembly systems programming. The main things I’ve learned from these experiences though is the importance of teamwork and collaboration to make large projects be better than the sum of their programmer’s experiences. I hope to bring that same energy to a new workplace and work with a team to create novel solutions to existing problems and uncover new ones.</p>
