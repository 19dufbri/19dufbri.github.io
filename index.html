            <p>Welcome to my career portfolio, an overview of my experiences and projects over
                the past few years. Here you’ll find projects - both professional and personal -
                along with my resume, and a link to my blog where I discuss current tech that
                interests me.</p>

            <p>A senior in Computer Science & Engineering at <i>The</i> Ohio State University, I
                have a range of experience and interests both technical and personal.</p>
            <p>I've always been fascinated by computers from the first computer games I played
                when I was a kid. At first, I played the games for fun, but as I got older I
                began to wonder how they really worked inside. Little did I know but this
                childhood curiosity would set me on a course that I still follow today. With
                encouragement from a couple of amazing teachers, I embarked on a journey to
                learn how computers work and build those same programs that amazed me as a
                kid.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've built a range of projects - both personally and
                professionally - and explored a wide range of topics. From a beginning in HTML+
                CSS, moving to helping found a software company with my friends after high
                school, and my internships with Android and React, I've gathered experience
                across technologies and disciplines.</p>
            <p>Through these experiences I've also gained many soft-skills - communication,
                project management, and leadership. Originally learned at a scout leadership
                camp, I've learned through practice how to use these skills to accelerate
                projects and encourage collaboration.</p>
            <p>Aside from technology, I'm a collegiate rower with The Ohio State Crew and the
                Safety & Equipment officer within that organization. This affords me the
                opportunity to compete at a national level while also managing an equipment
                portfolio of nearly $150,000.</p>
            <p>If you have questions or are interested in contacting me you can reach me at
                any time via my email at
                <u><a href="mailto:contact@brian-duffy.dev">contact@brian-duffy.dev</a></u>,
                I hope to hear from you, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.</p>
