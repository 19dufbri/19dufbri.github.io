				<h2>Brian Duffy's Career Portfolio</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>Welcome to my career portfolio, a roundup of my experiences and projects over the past few years. Here you’ll find several pages with information pertaining to various aspects of my professional career. Starting with a overview of my experiences on the home page, a declaration of my career goals, several of the projects that I think define my experiences with their own sub-pages and finally my resume.</p>
				<p>I’ve studied for the past few years trying to understand the deeper foundations of computing through my school work at the Ohio State University, my personal projects, and my work with Audio Odyssey, a software development company started by me and a few friends. These experiences have given me a powerful toolkit to generate new and interesting solutions to existing problems and generate new ideas for products and platforms. I hope to expand my knowledge and experiences in the coming years and develop software professionally.</p>
				<p>If you have questions or are interested in contacting me you can reach me at any time via my email at <u><a href="mailto:duffy.348@osu.edu">duffy.348@osu.edu</a></u>, I hope to hear from you and I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.</a></p>
